    ## üêõ Bug Fixes

    - `[OPERATOR]` Fixed a bug where machines in the `InPlaceUpdating` phase were incorrectly transferred to the new machine set during inplace updates. This caused the machine controller to miss updating the phase to `InPlaceUpdateSuccessful`, resulting in machines getting stuck or marked as `InPlaceUpdateFailed`. by @acumino [#1020]
